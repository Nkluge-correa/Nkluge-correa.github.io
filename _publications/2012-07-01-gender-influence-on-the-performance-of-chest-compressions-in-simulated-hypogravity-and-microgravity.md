**Abstract** 

In the event of a cardiac arrest during microgravity exposure, external chest compressions (ECCs), which form the central part of basic life support, should be carried out while the advanced life support equipment is being deployed. This study aimed to determine if there was any gender difference in the effectiveness of performing ECCs using a body suspension device to simulate lunar and Martian hypogravity and microgravity. The volunteers performed ECCs during simulated microgravity (using the Evetts-Russomano method): lunar, Martian, and Earth/Control. Each volunteer performed three sets of 30 compressions with 6 s rest in between. The volunteers had their heart rate increased and used the Borg scale to rate the intensity of work after each protocol. The mean depth compressions for men across all gravitational simulations were higher than those for women, but both sexes performed effective ECCs in the two tested hypogravity states. During simulated microgravity, men performed significantly deeper ECCs (mean ± SD of 45.07 ± 4.75 mm) than women (mean ± SD of 30.37 ± 4.75 mm). None of the women achieved the required mean depth of ECCs. Although heart rate increased more in women, no significant difference in Borg scale scores was observed between genders during or after ECC performance in microgravity. The results suggest both genders can perform effective ECCs during simulated hypogravity. Women, however, cannot perform effective ECCs during microgravity simulation. These findings indicate a gender difference in the performance of the Evetts-Russomano method.
