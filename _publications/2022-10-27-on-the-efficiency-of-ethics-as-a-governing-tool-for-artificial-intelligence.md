**Abstract** 

The 4th Industrial Revolution is the culmination of the digital age. Nowadays, technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, genetics, and artificial intelligence promise to transform our world and the way we live. Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety is an emerging research field that has been gaining popularity in recent years. Several private, public, and non-governmental organizations have published guidelines proposing ethical principles for regulating the use and development of autonomous intelligent systems. Meta-analyses of the AI Ethics research field point to convergence on certain principles that supposedly govern the AI industry. However, little is known about the effectiveness of this form of Ethics. In this paper, we would like to conduct a critical analysis of the current state of AI Ethics and argue that this form of governance, based on principled ethical guidelines, is insufficient to regulate the AI industry and its developers. Drastic changes are necessary, both in the training processes of professionals in the fields related to the development of software and intelligent systems and in the increased regulation of these professionals and their industry. To this end, the law should benefit from recent contributions from bioethics, to make the contributions of AI ethics to governance explicit in legal terms.
