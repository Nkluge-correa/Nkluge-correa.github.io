**Abstract** 

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has seen tremendous growth in recent years, bringing numerous benefits and conveniences. However, this expansion has also raised ethical concerns, including privacy breaches, algorithmic discrimination, security and reliability issues, transparency concerns, and other unintended consequences. To determine whether a global consensus exists on the ethical principles that should govern AI applications and to contribute to the development of future regulations, this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 200 governance policies and ethical guidelines for AI use published by public bodies, academic institutions, private companies, and civil society organizations worldwide. We identified at least 17 resonating principles prevalent in the policies and guidelines of our dataset, released as an open-source database and tool. We present the limitations of a global-scale analysis and critically evaluate our findings, highlighting areas of consensus that should be incorporated into future regulatory efforts.
