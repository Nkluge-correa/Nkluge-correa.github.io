**Abstract** 

What do Cyberpunk and AI Ethics have to do with each other? Cyberpunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that explores the post-human relationships between human experience and technology. One similarity between AI Ethics and Cyberpunk literature is that both seek to explore future social and ethical problems that our technological advances may bring upon society. In recent years, an increasing number of ethical matters involving AI have been highlighted and debated, and several ethical principles and guidelines have been proposed as governance policies for the tech industry. However, would this be the role of AI Ethics? To serve as a soft and ambiguous version of the law? We want to advocate, in this article, for a more Cyberpunk approach to AI Ethics, with a more democratic form of governance. In this study, we will seek to expose some of the deficits of the underlying power structures of the AI industry and suggest that AI governance be subject to public opinion, so that "good AI" can become "good AI for all."
