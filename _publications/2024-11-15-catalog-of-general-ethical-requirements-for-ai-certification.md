**Abstract** 

This whitepaper offers normative and practical guidance for developers of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to achieve "Trustworthy AI". In it, we present overall ethical requirements and six ethical principles, along with value-specific recommendations for tools to implement these principles in technology. Our value-specific recommendations address the principles of fairness, privacy and data protection, safety and robustness, sustainability, transparency, explainability, and truthfulness. For each principle, we also present examples of criteria for risk assessment and categorization of AI systems and applications in line with the categories of the European Union (EU) AI Act. Our work is aimed at stakeholders who can use it as a potential blueprint to meet the minimum ethical requirements for trustworthy AI and AI Certification.
