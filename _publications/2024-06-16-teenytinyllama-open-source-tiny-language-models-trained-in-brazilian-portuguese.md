excerpt: 'This study presents TeenyTinyLlama, a pair of compact, open‑foundation language models designed for Brazilian Portuguese. By addressing the limitations of multilingual LLMs in low‑resource settings, it demonstrates how smaller, permissively licensed models can offer practical, community‑driven alternatives for localized text generation.'

**Abstract** 

Large language models  (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their progress has not been equal across languages. While most LLMs are trained in high-resource languages like English, multilingual models generally underperform monolingual ones. Additionally, aspects of their multilingual foundation sometimes constrain the outputs they produce, such as computational demands and licensing regimes. In this study, we document the development of open-foundation models tailored for use in low-resource settings, their limitations, and their benefits. This is the _TeenyTinyLlama_ pair: two compact models for Brazilian Portuguese text generation. We release them under the permissive Apache 2.0 license on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/TeenyTinyLlama) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nicholasKluge/teenytinyllama-6582ea8129e72d1ea4d384f1) for community use and further development.
