          <i><h3 class="link publication__title">Tucano: Advancing Neural Text Generation for Portuguese</h3></i>
            <div class="publication__abstract">
              Significant advances have been made in natural language processing in recent years. However, our current deep learning approach to language 
              modeling requires substantial resources in terms of data and computation. One of the side effects of this data-hungry 
              paradigm is the current schism between languages, separating those considered high-resource, where most of the development 
              happens and resources are available, and the low-resource ones, which struggle to attain the same level of performance and 
              autonomy. This study aims to introduce a new set of resources to stimulate the future development of neural text generation 
              in Portuguese. In this work, we document the development of <i><b class="gradiant-effect">GigaVerbo</b></i>, a concatenation of deduplicated 
              Portuguese text corpora amounting to 200 billion tokens. Via this corpus, we trained a series of decoder-transformers 
              named <i><b class="gradiant-effect">Tucano</b></i>. Our models perform equal or superior to other Portuguese and multilingual language models of similar size in several 
              Portuguese benchmarks. The evaluation of our models also reveals that model performance on many currently available benchmarks 
              used by the Portuguese NLP community has <i><b class="gradiant-effect">little to no correlation</b></i> with the scaling of token ingestion during 
              training, highlighting the limitations of such evaluations when it comes to the assessment of Portuguese generative language models. 
              All derivatives of our study are openly released on <a href="https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/Tucano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b class="gradiant-effect">GitHub</b></a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/TucanoBR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b class="gradiant-effect">Hugging Face</b></a>.

              This whitepaper offers normative and practical guidance for developers of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to achieve "Trustworthy AI". 
              In it, we present overall ethical requirements and six ethical principles with value-specific recommendations for tools to implement these principles into

          <i><h3 class="link publication__title">Dynamic Normativity: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Value Alignment</h3></i>
            <div class="publication__abstract">
              The critical inquiry pervading the realm of Philosophy, and perhaps extending its influence across all Humanities disciplines, revolves around the 
              intricacies of morality and normativity. Surprisingly, in recent years, this thematic thread has woven its way into an unexpected domain, one not 
              conventionally associated with pondering "what ought to be": the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Central to morality and AI, we find 
              "alignment", a problem related to the challenges of expressing human goals and values in a manner that artificial systems can follow without leading 
              to unwanted adversarial effects. More explicitly and with our current paradigm of AI development in mind, we can think of alignment as teaching human 
              values to non-anthropomorphic entities trained through opaque, gradient-based learning techniques. This work addresses alignment as a technical-philosophical 
              problem that requires solid philosophical foundations and practical implementations that bring normative theory to AI system development. 
              To accomplish this, we propose two sets of necessary and sufficient conditions that, we argue, should be considered in any alignment process. 
              While necessary conditions serve as metaphysical and metaethical roots that pertain to the permissibility of alignment, sufficient conditions 
              establish a blueprint for aligning AI systems under a learning-based paradigm. After laying such foundations, we present implementations of this 
              approach by using state-of-the-art techniques and methods for aligning general-purpose language systems. We call this framework <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b class="gradiant-effect">Dynamic Normativity</b></a>. 
              Its central thesis is that any alignment process under a learning paradigm that cannot fulfill its necessary and sufficient conditions will fail in 
              producing aligned systems.

          <i><h3 class="link publication__title">Crossing the principle-practice gap in AI ethics with ethical problem-solving</h3></i>
            <div class="publication__abstract">
              The past years have presented a surge in (AI) development, fueled by breakthroughs in deep learning, increased computational 
              power, and substantial investments in the field. Given the generative capabilities of more recent AI systems, the era of 
              large-scale AI models has transformed various domains that intersect our daily lives. However, this progress raises concerns 
              about the balance between technological advancement, ethical considerations, safety measures, and financial interests. 
              Moreover, using such systems in sensitive areas amplifies our general ethical awareness, prompting a re-emergence of 
              debates on governance, regulation, and human values. However, amidst this landscape, how to bridge the principle-practice 
              gap separating ethical discourse from the technical side of AI development remains an open problem. In response to this 
              challenge, the present work proposes a framework to help shorten this gap: ethical problem-solving (EPS). EPS is a 
              methodology promoting responsible, human-centric, and value-oriented AI development. The framework's core resides in 
              translating principles into practical implementations using impact assessment surveys and a differential recommendation 
              methodology. We utilize EPS as a blueprint to propose the implementation of an Ethics as a Service Platform, currently 
              available as a simple demonstration. We released all framework components openly and with a permissive license, hoping 
              the community would adopt and extend our efforts into other contexts. Available in <a href="https://nkluge-correa.github.io/ethical-problem-solving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b class="gradiant-effect">this URL</b></a>.

            <div class="publication__abstract">
              Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their progress has yet to be 
              equal across languages. While most LLMs are trained in high-resource languages like English, multilingual models generally 
              underperform monolingual ones. Additionally, aspects of their multilingual foundation sometimes restrict the byproducts 
              they produce, like computational demands and licensing regimes. In this study, we document the development of

            <div class="publication__abstract">
              The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, bringing forth 
              numerous benefits and conveniences. However, this expansion has also provoked ethical concerns, such as privacy breaches, 
              algorithmic discrimination, security and reliability issues, transparency, and other unintended consequences. 
              To determine whether a global consensus exists regarding the ethical principles that should govern AI applications 
              and to contribute to the formation of future regulations, this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 200 governance 
              policies and ethical guidelines for AI usage published by public bodies, academic institutions, private companies,

              What do Cyberpunk and AI Ethics have to do with each other? One similarity between AI Ethics and Cyberpunk literature is that both seek 
              to explore future social and ethical problems that our technological advances may bring upon society. In recent years, an 
              increasing number of ethical matters involving AI have been pointed and debated, and several ethical principles and guides 
              have been suggested as governance policies for the tech industry. However, would this be the role of AI Ethics? To serve as a soft and 
              ambiguous version of the law?

            <div class="publication__abstract">
              Are there any indications that a Technological Singularity may be on the horizon? In trying to answer these questions, the 
              authors made a small introduction to the area of safety research in artificial intelligence. The authors review some of the 
              current paradigms in the development of autonomous intelligent systems, searching for evidence that may indicate the coming 
              of a possible Technological Singularity.

            <i><h3 class="link publication__title">Metanormativity: Solving questions of moral and empirical uncertainty</h3></i>
            <div class="publication__abstract">
              How can someone reconcile the desire to eat meat, and a tendency toward vegetarian ideals? How should we reconcile 
              contradictory moral values? How can we aggregate different moral theories? How individual preferences can be 
              fairly aggregated to represent a will, norm, or social decision? Conflict resolution and preference aggregation 
              are tasks that intrigue philosophers, economists, sociologists, decision theorists, and many other scholars, 
              being a rich interdisciplinary area for research. When trying to solve questions about moral uncertainty a 
              meta understanding of the concept of normativity can help us to develop strategies to deal with norms themselves. 
              2 nd-order normativity, or norms about norms, is a hierarchical way to think about how to combine many 
              different normative structures and preferences into a single coherent decision. That is what metanormativity 
              is all about, a way to answer: what should we do when we don't know what to do? In this study, we will review 
              a decision-making strategy dealing with moral uncertainty, Maximization of Expected Choice-Worthiness.

                Given the similarity to this metanormative strategy to expected utility theory, we will also show that it is possible 
                to integrate both models to address decision-making problems in situations of empirical and moral uncertainty</b></a>.
