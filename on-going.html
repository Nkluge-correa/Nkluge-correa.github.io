            <div class="research__abstract">
                Worldwide AI Ethics is a <b class="gradiant-effect">systematic literature review</b> done by AIRES researchers. 
                Building on the work done by other meta-analysts, this study presents an analysis of 
                200 documents related to AI ethics and governance, presenting a collection of 
                typologies used to classify our sample, all condensed into an interactive, 
                freely accessible online tool.

                one meta-analysis of the field. For this, we need to keep updating our dashboard with 
                new documents. The research involves searching and analyzing documents (AI Ethics 
                Guidelines, Bills, Legislation, Governance Frameworks, Codes of Conduct) related to 
                AI Governance. Documents and their respective information are submitted via google 
                forms to a central spreadsheet for further analysis and post-processing. We would 
                like to make new publications as soon as we have a bigger and more representative 
                sample size (e.g., 300 documents). We would like to have the help of people who 
                understand different languages, so we can analyze documents from different places 
                and cultures.
