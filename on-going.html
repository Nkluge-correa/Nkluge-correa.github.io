                is a <b>systematic literature review done by AIRES researchers</b>. Building on the work done by other 
                  meta-analysts, this study presents an analysis of <i>200</i> documents related to AI ethics and governance, presenting a 
                  collection of typologies used to classify our sample, all condensed into an interactive, freely accessible online tool.

                Extend the Worldwide AI Ethics sample. <b>We intend to keep on making AIRES the number one meta-analysis of the field</b>>. 
                For this, we need to keep updating our dashboard with new documents. <i>The research involves searching and analyzing documents
                  (AI Ethics Guidelines, Bills, Legislation, Governance Frameworks, Codes of Conduct) related to AI Governance</i>. 
                  Documents and their respective information are submitted via google forms to a central spreadsheet for further analysis and 
                  post-processing. <b>We would like to make new publications as soon as we have a bigger and more representative sample size (e.g., 300 documents).</b> 
                  We would like to have the help of <i>people who understand different languages</i>, so we can analyze documents from different places and cultures.
