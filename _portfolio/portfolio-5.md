The Worldwide AI Ethics (WAIE) dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring 200 AI governance policies and ethical guidelines collected from governments, industry, academia, and civil society worldwide. It transforms the project’s large‑scale meta‑analysis into a searchable, visual environment where users can examine recurring ethical principles, compare documents, and navigate the global landscape of AI governance.

The dashboard integrates the project’s open‑source datasets, embeddings, and n‑gram analyses, enabling researchers to quickly identify patterns, overlaps, and divergences across regions and institutions. By centralizing these materials in an accessible tool, WAIE supports evidence‑based research and helps inform the development of future AI regulatory frameworks.
