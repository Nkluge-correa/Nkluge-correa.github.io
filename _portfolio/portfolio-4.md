Ethical Problem-Solving (EPS) is a framework to promote the development of safe and ethical artificial intelligence. EPS is divided into an evaluation stage (performed via **Algorithmic Impact Assessment** tools) and a recommendation stage (the **WHY-SHOULD-HOW** method). Both these stages represent distinct steps in a human-centered _EaaS_ (**Ethics as a Service**) framework developed by _Nicholas Kluge Corrêa_, _James William Santos_, _Camila Galvão_, _Marcelo Pasetti_, _Dieine Schiavon_, _Faizah Naqvi_, _Robayet Hossain_, and _Nythamar de Oliveira_.
