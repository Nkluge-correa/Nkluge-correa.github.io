Education
======
* Ph.D (Summa cum laude) by the University of Bonn (Philosophy), 2024
* Ph.D (Summa cum laude) by the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (Philosophy), 2024
* M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, 2017
* B.S. in Health Sciences, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, 2014

Work experience
======
* **Feb 2024 —  Present:** Postdoc Researcher at Center for Science and Thought, University of Bonn
  * At the [Center for Science and Thought](https://www.cst.uni-bonn.de/en), I work on the "Zertifizierte KI project, one of the KI.NRW flagship projects financed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization, and Energy of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, which seeks to develop certification methods for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI).
  * Currently, I'm also one of the Principal Investigators behind the TRA6-funded Polyglot project.

* **Oct 2023 — May 2024**: Research Scholar at University of Bonn
  * I was a PhD research scholar at the University of Bonn. There, I have developed (1) a series of [language models and datasets](https://huggingface.co/collections/nicholasKluge/aira) designed to align large language models, and (2) a series of [open-access educational lectures](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/TeenyTinyCastle) on how to create ethical and safe ML systems.

* **Jun 2022 — May 2024**: Project Lead at RAIES
  * Here, I help in the coordination and development of several research efforts on a
multi-stakeholder research network called RAIES ([Network for Ethical and Safe Artificial Intelligence](https://raies.org/)). Primarily, I have acted in the: 
    * Development of algorithmic impact assessment tools.
    * Development of value-sensitive design tools.
    * Mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in their research.
    * Collaboration with researchers from other universities and institutes to create successful interdisciplinary projects.

* **Mar 2021 — Apr 2024**: President at AIRES at PUCRS
  * I founded a non-profit organization called AIRES ([AI Robotics Ethics Society](https://www.airespucrs.org/)) at PUCRS, which remains actively engaged in research and policy-making to this day. Here, I helped in:
    * Developing policy research to help shape the governance of AI technologies (examples can be found [here](https://www.airespucrs.org/en/nota-tecnica-frt) and [here](https://www.airespucrs.org/en/nota-tecnica-aires)).
    * Developing [foundational research](https://nkluge-correa.github.io/worldwide_AI-ethics/) in the field of AI Ethics.

* **Mar 2010 — Dec 2014**: Research Assistant at PUCRS
  * During my bachelor's in Health Sciences, I assisted in studies related to the biomechanics of exercises in microgravity and the effects of zero gravity on human physiology. This work led to co-authorship on [several peer-reviewed publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas-Correa-2).
  
Third-Party Funding
======
* I have secured third-party support from funding bodies in Brazil and Germany, including DAAD, CNPq, FAPERGS, and TRA 6 Sustainable Futures. Most notably:
  * All my graduate studies (MSc and Doctorate) were financed via the award of study grants by agencies like DAAD and CNPq.
  * During my stay at PUCRS, I founded the AI Robotics Ethics Society, a successful non-profit think tank that later gave rise to RAIES (Network for Safe and Ethical AI). The Network was established with a grant of approximately 3 million Reais (~500,000 Euros), awarded to AIRES and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, based on a project proposal I authored during my PhD.
  * During my stay at the University of Bonn, I co-initiated the Polyglot Project with Dr. Aniket Sen—a TRA6-funded initiative designed to promote openness and diversity in modern NLP by developing foundation models and related resources for
low-resource languages.
