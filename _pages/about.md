Hi, I'm Nicholas 👋

I am a postdoc researcher at the Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information Technology (b-it) / CAISA Lab, at the [**University of Bonn**](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en) (Germany). I am the principal investigator behind projects like [**Tucano**](https://nkluge-correa.github.io/Tucano/), [**ViTucano**](https://huggingface.co/collections/TucanoBR/vitucano-v1), [**TeenyTinyLlama**](https://nkluge-correa.github.io/TeenyTinyLlama/), and [**Worldwide AI Ethics**](https://nkluge-correa.github.io/worldwide_AI-ethics/). My doctoral dissertation, [**"Dynamic Normativity: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Value Alignment,"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11039) is currently available on arXiv.  
  
My main areas of research are _Deep Learning_, _Philosophy of AI_, and _Alignment_. I like writing (text/code), studying, skateboarding, and playing D&D.
