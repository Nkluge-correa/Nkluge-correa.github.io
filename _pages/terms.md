## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is essential. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that are received and collected, and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information with anyone without your direct consent.

### Log Files

Like many other websites, this site uses log files to learn when, from where, and how often traffic flows to it. The information in these log files includes:

* Internet Protocol addresses (IP)
* Types of browsers
* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* Date and time stamp
* Referring and exit pages
* Number of clicks

All of this information is not linked to anything personally identifiable.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

When you visit this site, "convenience" cookies are stored on your computer when you submit a comment to help you log in faster to [Disqus](https://disqus.com) the next time you leave a comment.

Third-party advertisers may also place and read cookies on your browser and/or use web beacons to collect information. This site has no access to or control over these cookies. You should review the privacy policies of all third-party ad servers for more information about their practices and how to opt out.

If you'd like to disable cookies, you can do so through your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the websites of the specific web browsers.

#### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).
